# Vertice Shader
In this small assignment I had to figure out how to deform a mesh with the use of shaders.
I tried several different approaches but the one I ended up using was the easiest and quickest to use.
It may not be the most beautiful result but it is a working one.

I learned a bit more about vertices and how to deform them using shaders.
I don't mind doing this I find working on shaders quite fun, but I rather not make it my living.

The model I used for this example project is Unity-chan (from the unity asset store)
I do not own any of the textures, models or animations from that model, and is purely
for example purposes only.

## Features

## Software Analysis 
I picked out a few options to make this project in:
Unity:
	Unity is the engine I have worked most with and I know my ways around it quite well.
	It is also a very friendly engine and has a lot of the tools ready for use and it is documented well.
	Unity has some good shader support and allow the user to quickly make one, and assign it to a material.

Unreal:
	Unreal engine is not my engine, I have trouble finding my way in it and every time I try to use it it either crashes
	or they removed more c++ scripting support.
	Almost everything goes by blueprints from what I have experienced and seen on the internet and I don't want to do blueprints.
	Not very friendly to non experienced users, it has a quite messy interface in my opinion and tools and other stuff is difficult to find.

Java
	Java is one of my least favourite languages to use, I can't get it to work so this one is by far not the one I am going use for this.
	But I have seen some amazing stuff being made with it (example: Minecraft)
	And from things I have read there's a lot of libraries allowing me to make meshes and deform them on the fly with code.
	If I wasn't allowed to use Unity and got my Java to work properly I would've definitely used this.

Conclusion:
	I chose Unity in the end, I know my ways around it the best of the softwares/engines I looked at.
	And in the small timescale we have for these assignments here at college I rather use something I know than spend days trying to
	find my ways in unknown enviorements. For smaller projects I will try to not always relent on using Unity and experiment with other languages and engines.

(Disclaimer: These where not all the softwares/engines I looked at and analized.)

## Goals of this project 
- The goal of this project was to learn more abotu vertices, shaders and mesh rendering.
